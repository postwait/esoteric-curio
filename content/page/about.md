## Personal

I was born in 1978 and was a military brat. My formative primary education took place in Howard County, Maryland. I skipped a few grades and in 1994 I matriculated to [The Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) where I started pursuing a dual degree in Electrical Engineering and Physics; neither of which were achieved. In 1997, I received my B.S.E. in Computer Science and entered the Ph.D. program in the [Center for Networking and Distributed Systems](https://www.cnds.jhu.edu/). 1998 rolled around delivering me my M.S.E. in Computer Science where I focused on graphics and randomized algorithms in distributed systems.  I went on to research resource allocation techniques in distributed systems during four years of post-graduate work where in 2003 I was asked to leave the Ph.D. program, but that story is only told after you buy me a beer.

I love food. In particular, I love meat. I thoroughly enjoy a great number of vices including fine [scotches, bourbons, whiskeys](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wYdaDTa5f-8/UqegttTscCI/AAAAAAAAEJw/qW50EE8LPf8/w691-h518-no/20131210_181515_LLS.jpg), beer, wine, cigars and bacon.

I practice Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu [^fn:1] and Ninjutsu martial arts.

## Professional

After a very brief stint doing government contracting and watching my soul seep out through my pores, I quit and started my own business.

[My mother](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/sherry-schlossnagle/1/70/450) and I founded [OmniTI](https://omniti.com/) in 1997 where I was the CEO for 17 years. Two years after starting OmniTI, I was joined by [my brother George](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/george-schlossnagle/0/449/a20). In 2008, we spun off a digital messaging company called [Message Systems](https://www.messagesystems.com/) which later became [Sparkpost](https://www.sparkpost.com) and was ultimately sold to [MessageBird](https://www.messagebird.com/). In 2009 we started a company called [Fontdeck](https://fontdeck.com/) to bring richer typography to the web. In 2010, we spun off a company called [Circonus](https://www.circonus.com/) to change the world of systems montioring to be more data driven.

In 2014, I stepped down as CEO at OmniTI to focus on Circonus.

From July 2015 until March 2016, I took a sabbatical to [travel the world with my family](https://schlossini.tresbon.voyage/t/watt).

## Industry and Volunteering

I am very active volunteer with the ACM [^fn:2] where I am a Distinguished Member and have held or do hold positions on the [ACM Professions/Practitioners Board](https://learning.acm.org/about/professions_board.cfm), the [ACM Queue Editorial board](https://queue.acm.org/editorialboardx.cfm), the [ACM Publications Board](https://www.acm.org/publications/publications-board-committees), the [ACM Digital Library Board](https://dl.acm.org/about/dlboard), and the [ACM Council](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-council) as an elected Member at Large.

In 2022, I joined the board of stewards of [The African Women Entrepreneurship Cooperative](https://www.thecge.net/institutes-initiatives/african-women-entrepreneurship-cooperative/).

I wrote a book on [Scalable Internet Architectures](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067232699X/lethargy-20/104-9600898-8379162?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&link_code=xm2) and content in [Web Operations](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449377440/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449377440&linkCode=as2&tag=lethargy-20) and [Seeking SRE](https://www.amazon.com/Seeking-SRE-Conversations-Running-Production/dp/1491978864).

I've spoken at over 100 industry events and conferences.  A handful of recorded talks can be [found on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmI-gVUhoHby1WpBPqcfI3NHD4n3VCH9N).
